Citi Bike Project

"Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 12,000 bikes and 750 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it’s a fun and affordable way to get around town."

Most Citi Bike users in 2018 were male subscribers and they are in their 30’s. Weekdays are very busy when comparing with the weekends. The busiest day is Wednesday. The busiest time of the year in the 3rd Quarter. The top 10 stations where the biking started and ended are in NJ. The #1 station to start and end rides in 2018 was the Grove St Path located in Jersey City, New Jersey.
